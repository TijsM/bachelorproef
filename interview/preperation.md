# Progressive web applications 

## future of PWA's 

One of the biggest reasons why windows on mobile didn't work was convincing deverlopers to create applications for windows. 

When Huawei couldn't use google services anymore this was probably also the biggest problem for huawei.

Both of these parties have resources enough to develop their own OS. But convincing developers to develop for their OS is not that easy.

At the moment there is no doubt that Google is pushing the PWA movement the most. And it's really 'googly' thing to do, but I don't really understand why they are doing this.

Isn't PWA's a thread to google, becauce this could mean to losing their oligopoly with Apple.

How do you see this this evolving for other parties and do you think that google will keep on inovating on PWA's?


## installation of PWA's

We, as 'tech-savy' people know that if an installation prompt is fired, that it is a pwa and nothing harmfull.

The problem though is that most non 'tech-savy' people just continue using the webapp without installing it.

propably also not using the features that a pwa can provide 
- example: they won't use a PWA offline, because they don't know that it's capable of doing that.

Do you have a solution for this and do you expect a shift in user behavior?

## combination of PWA and native

What technologies/ approaches do you advise to combine a PWA and a native application.

is there a way to develop PWA's and enhance this pwa with features that are only available for native such as push notifications on IOS.

What is your view on Ionic?


## Adoption

Some features that provide a better experience are fairly easy to implement. Why are most of the big websites not making use of these features?

Why does facebook not have some basic caching whick caches the application shell and provides some offline functionality?

## Apple

Apple is as often not that keen on giving acces to their OS. This is the case for PWA's. Do you expect better support for IOS and macOS and safari?
