# Progressive web applications 

Hi, thanks for taking time for me! i do really appreciate it. I did prepare some questions, but if there are other topics that you think are relevant to PWA's, please share them ;-)

## Intro

When did you first **hear of PWA's** and when did you first came in touch with them. What were your initial thoughts. 

## Selling points

How and why would you convince your team to make you next application instead of a regular site of native app.

what are for you the main "selling" points of a PWA.

## Disadvantages

as the support is for PWA's is growing and the web is able to access more and more features of the OS (camera, gps, ...) there are still some limitations. 

- what types of applications benefit the most from the features that PWA's offer
- what applications wouldn't you implement as a PWA
- what are according to you the main disadvantages of PWA

## Adoption

- Some features that provide a better experience are **fairly easy** to implement. 
Why are most of the big websites **not making use of these features**?
Why does facebook not have some basic caching which caches the application shell and provides some offline functionality?

- **react.js** makes it really easy to implement to convert a regular application to a offline capable PWA. But writing your own custom service worker is really cumbersome. Can you explain why this is not easier with a big framework as react?

## Future of PWA's 

One of the biggest reasons why windows on mobile didn't work was **convincing developers** to create applications for windows. 

When Huawei couldn't use google services anymore this was probably also the biggest problem for huawei.

Both of these parties have resources enough to develop their own OS. But convincing developers to develop for their OS is not that easy.

At the moment there is no doubt that Google is pushing the PWA movement the most. And it's really 'googly' thing to do, but I don't really understand why they are doing this.

Isn't **PWA's a thread to google**, because this could mean to losing their oligopoly with Apple.

How do you see this this evolving for other parties and do you think that google will keep on innovating on PWA's?


## Is not being in the app-store an advantage or a disadvantage?

you don't depend on apple or google to distribute the app. But you also loose a lot of traction by not being in a store.

Some people will think an app in the app store is more credible then a webapp

## Installation of PWA's

We, as 'tech-savvy' people know that if an **installation prompt** is fired, that it is a pwa and nothing harmful.

The problem though is that most non 'tech-savvy' people just continue using the webapp without installing it.

probably also not using the features that a pwa can provide 
- example: **they won't use a PWA offline,** because they don't know that it's capable of doing that.

Do you have a solution for this and do you expect a shift in user behavior?

## Combination of PWA and native

What technologies/ approaches do you advise to combine a PWA and a native application.

is there a way to develop PWA's and enhance this pwa with features that are only available for native such as push notifications on IOS.

What is your view on Ionic?


## Apple

Apple is as often not that keen on giving access to their OS. This is the case for PWA's. **Do you expect better support** for IOS and macOS and safari?


## Beginning of pwa's

you have a nice amount of experience, **what are the biggest shifts you have experienced** on the web. 
- Do you think that pwa's will stay a 'niche'? Or do you think it will become the mainstream for webapplications to register a service worker and add service worker functionality?


## Extra
 
- Do you believe that one day, all applications (mobile/ desktop) will be written with web technologies?
- favorite PWA
- favorite WEB API

monetize pwa's
